## Questions

In a language of your choice, solve the following questions in the fewest possible steps and include test cases when applicable. 

1. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Foo” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Bar”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FooBar”. 

...Example output: 1 2 Foo 4 Bar Foo 7 8 Foo Bar 11 Foo 13 14 FooBar ... 

2. Write a function that determines the number of even numbers that appear in a range of integers 0..n, where n is supplied as the sole argument to your function. 

...Example: even_integers(5) Example output: 3 

3. Given the following pseudo code, determine the range of possible values for “a”. 

```
x = random_int(1,6)
y = random_int(1,6) 
z = random_int(1,6) 
a = x + y + z 
```

4. Given: words = ['one', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'three', 'two']

...Remove the duplicates. 

5. And finally, tell us in 1 to 3 paragraphs how you would build a simple web based chat application. Include the technologies you would use and why you would use them, as well as a high level explanation of how you would code the application.
